the business idea i'd go with would be one that teaches people either self defence or dancing
The name would be: the Dancing Martial Arts Dojo

the best legal structure for my company likely would be a Benefit Corporation as my company would be dedicating itself to the community in teaching the people how to dance or how to use martial arts/basic self defense. Which would mean taking the employees, communities, and the environment into consideration would be really important.
